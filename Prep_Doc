=================
Coding:
=================


1) Given a string, check if it is a palindrome by ignoring spaces. E.g. race car would be a palindrome.
2) Given two very large strings, consisting of only digits, multiply the two strings and return the result as a string.


    Converting Decimal Number lying between 1 to 3999 to Roman Numerals
    Find all triplets with zero sum
    Largest subset whose all elements are Fibonacci numbers
    Calculate maximum value using ‘+’ or ‘*’ sign between two numbers in a string
    Convert Ternary Expression to a Binary Tree
    Converting Roman Numerals to Decimal lying between 1 to 3999
    Count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k
    Decode a string recursively encoded as count followed by substring
    Find if string is K-Palindrome or not | Set 2
    Find Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree
    Find subarray with given sum | Set 1 (Nonnegative Numbers)
    Given two unsorted arrays, find all pairs whose sum is x
    Greedy Algorithms | Set 1 (Activity Selection Problem)
    Look-and-Say Sequence
    Smallest subarray with sum greater than a given value
    Program to add two binary strings
    Rearrange a string in sorted order followed by the integer sum

Medium Level

    Boggle | Set 2 (Using Trie)
    Count Possible Decodings of a given Digit Sequence
    Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees | Set 1
    Largest Rectangular Area in a Histogram | Set 2
    Largest sum subarray with at-least k numbers
    Multiply Large Numbers represented as Strings


Hard Level

    Median in a stream of integers (running integers)
    Find m-th smallest value in k sorted arrays

1. You have an array of n elements, and a sum. Check if any 2 elements in the array sum to the given sum. ( Expected time complexity O(n). Use hashing)

2. Extended the previous problem to sum of 3 elements in the array summing up to the given sum.

Question 1: Write a function that takes a sorted list of integers and a target value k and counts the number of occurrences of k in the list.

Question 2: Find the maximum path sum in a binary tree.

-
1. Given a string, display the words in reverse order
I/p: I work at xyz
O/p: xyz at work I

2. Given a linked list modify the linked list as below
I/p: a x b c y z
O/p: a b c x y z

3. What is virtual memory

4. If I am designing a media player and I want to store songs and play them in random order
a) what data structure will you use to store songs?
b) how will select the next song to play in a way which prevents the same song being played in consecutive turn

BGP, TCP handshake, OSPF, lot of behavioral palindrome , arrange vowel and then consonant and given string, Regex

Due to Non-Disclosure agreement, I cannot disclose any questions here. But my advice would be clear all your networking fundamentals, their operations and how can you able to utilize them in real time networking operations and issues. Day to day working operations of VLAN, PVLAN, STP, RSTP, Split horizon, VRRP, HSRP, commonly used routing protocols such as OSPF, MPLS, BGP, RIP, EIGRP, IS-IS, ECMP, SNMP, ICMP, etc. In terms of coding, clear your data structure knowledge in terms of Network Automation, such as explain and code how to configure any of the routing protocols on one to may routers or switches at the same time. So be prepared well with python scripting language, network automation tools such as Ansible, automation libraries like Napalm, Netmiko, Paramiko. I think this would be enough for you to make through it. I was able to crack the interview but since I didn't had any relevant internship or full time experience, they didn't move forward with me, but advised me to get relevant experience for couple of months and reapply. Entire experience was very positive! I would definitely love to consider Facebook as my future place to work for.
